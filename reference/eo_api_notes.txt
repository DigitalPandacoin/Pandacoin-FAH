    You only need to query once every 3 hours since the data is not updated any more often than that. You can query more often to make coding easier, however *please* no more than one cycle per hour.
    This data is for personal / team use only. I don't want to see someone ripping off my stats page using my own data (which I have seen in the past).
    You can not charge a fee for whatever service or program if you are utilizing any of this data. The stats are meant to be free to all, it's for a good cause.
    The URLs below are simply examples, you will need to replace the team or user id with your own.
    If you need help or some custom data that isn't provided, please feel free to email me.
    Only use data from these feeds, attempting to parse the regular pages is a bad idea, and if I catch you I will block your IP.
    Try to rate limit your queries. By that I mean don't try to make a couple dozen queries in one second.
    Be aware that excessive amounts of queries (or queries per second) can get your IP blocked!
    XML is NOT an RSS feed, so don't email me saying you can't get it to work in your RSS program.
