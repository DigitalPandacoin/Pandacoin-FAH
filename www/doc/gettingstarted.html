			<h2 id="fah">Folding @ Home</h2>
				<p>Folding at home is a distributed computing system that helps Stanford University scientists studying Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's, and many cancers by simply running a piece of software on your computer. More than a 100K people are donating more than 20K teraflops of computing power. Honorary points are awarded by Standford for the computing work preformed and users can compete in teams for the most points.</p>
			<h2 id="rewards">The Reward System</h2>
				<p>We have created an automated payout system that pays the folding team weekly (late Saturday CST). Folders must use their Dogecoin wallet address as their folding user name and fold for the Dogefolders team #226715. The automated system will combine multiple rewards into one weekly payout. Some rewards give more Dogecoins to team members who folded more of the team's points, while others give some Dogecoins to each team member who folded any points.<p>
			<h2 id="website">The Website</h2>
				<p>We have created the website <a href="https://www.dogecoinfah.com">Dogecoinfah.com</a> to help with visibility and present information about the project. The website also has "live" data available about the current payout amount and details about past payouts.</p>
			<h2 id="getstarted">Getting Started</h2>
				<p>Begin by installing the Folding @ Home client and configuring it with your Dogecoin wallet address as your folding name and team #226715. Once your machine completes a folding work unit, Stanford will reward you with points. At the end of the week, the automated system will compare your points to the rest of the team and send Dogecoins to your wallet!</p>
